This is a fork of [Rizzo](https://github.com/fifthposition/rizzo), a static site generator, written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/).

If you clone or otherwise download this project, you can run

`groovy rizzo.groovy -s . -d published`

from the command line (in the project directory), and Rizzo will generate the example site in a subdir called `published`.
